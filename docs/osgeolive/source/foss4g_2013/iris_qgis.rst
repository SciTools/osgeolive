=============
Iris and QGIS
=============

Regularly gridded two-dimensional slices can be imported as QGIS raster layers
using the ``iris.experimental.raster.export_geotiff()``

See the Iris refererence documentation for details:
http://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/iris/iris/experimental/raster.html  


.. Note::

   Work has begun on creating a QGIS interface for Iris. Using this new code as
   a basis, it is possible to develop a plugin for QGIS that has similar
   functionality to the Cubeviz GUI, but with the advantage of being based
   within a powerful desktop GIS application.

   If you are interest in this feature, or would like to contribute to its
   development, please comment via the following page on github:

   https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy/pull/345

   Development of this plugin is a possible option for an Iris `code sprint
   <http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2013_Code_Sprint>`_ during the conference
   - let us know if you are interested in taking part.
