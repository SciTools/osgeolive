.. note::

   Iris was used to produce the Iris and Cartopy animation that was submitted to the FOSS4G 2013 `Map Gallery <http://2013.foss4g.org/programme/opening-up-the-map/>`_. For example code similar to that used to create the animation, see the `map gallery example <map_gallery_example/map_gallery_example.html>`_ code
