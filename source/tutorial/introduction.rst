Introduction
============

Thanks to the `OSGeo <http://www.osgeo.org>`_ community, the `Iris python library <https://github.com/scitools/iris>`_ is now available preinstalled as part of the `OSGeo Live 7.0 DVD <http://live.osgeo.org>`_.

The documentation for Iris that is included on the Live DVD is currently limited to a basic `overview <http://live.osgeo.org/en/overview/iris_overview.html>`_ and a `quickstart <http://live.osgeo.org/en/quickstart/iris_quickstart.html>`_ that points to the `standard Iris user guide <http://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/userguide/index.html>`_

Due to space limitations on the Live DVD, the version of Iris that you are using does not have all of the sample data that is required to work through the user guide. This introduction will help you to update your installation of Iris so that you are ready to follow the standard user guide.

This project also includes more advanced tutorials that demonstrate how Iris can be used with other open source tools that are also available preinstalled on OSGeo Live. These tutorials were initially created for `FOSS4G 2013 <http://2013.foss4g.org>`_, see the conference `workshop page <http://2013.foss4g.org/conf/programme/workshops/4/>`_ for details.

If you would like to try manually installing Iris without using the OSGeo Live DVD a number of installation recipes have been contributed by the community for different operating systems and are available in the SciTools `installation-recipes repository <https://github.com/SciTools/installation-recipes>`_.
